== Changelog ==

= 1.8.0 =

* Allows you to create custom urls to redirect to a page.

= 1.7.4 =

* I noticed that SEO Redirect 301 didn't want to play nice with some paid themes. I've come up with a solution to SmartStart and the fix could potentially fix other themes that work closely with Wordpress Theme code. 

= 1.7.3 =

* Fixed small bug with dependency checker.

= 1.7.2 =

* Better dependency installer. Fixed issue with empty redirect table.

= 1.7.1 =

* Added more Tom M8te functions to make it easier to manage.

= 1.6.4 =

* After looking at logs, I found duplicate entry errors, which didn't create them, just warned about them. This patch removes the chance of the warning.

= 1.6.3 =

* Small bug fix, happens rarely. If the database is corrupt and post id didn't exist it produced an error. This patch fixes it.

= 1.6.2 =

* Fixed bug with redirect. Sometimes the system redirects to an attachment, not a page or post, which makes no sense. Anyways I put a guard on it so if it tries to redirect to the attachment, it redirects to the page instead.

= 1.6.1 =

* Fixed bug with https urls.

= 1.6 =

* Dependent on plugin Tom M8te to make some features easier to code. There is no new features since 1.5.

= 1.5 =

* Fixed redirect posts to correct urls. Fixed delete redirects which did delete but didn't refresh changes at correct time.

= 1.4 =

* Fixed some typos, whoops.

= 1.3 =

* Better description on table when you haven't yet changed your urls.

= 1.2 =

* UI to show user which old urls are pointing to the new updated urls.

= 1.1 =

* Fixed up updating children urls. So now if parent slug name changes, the child slugs are updated as well. For example, lets say you have a page called http://localhost/cars with a child page http://localhost/cars/holden, if you change the slug name to car and you navigated to http://localhost/cars it will redirect you to http://localhost/car. Similarly if you navigated to http://localhost/cars/holden it will redirect you to http://localhost/car/holden.
