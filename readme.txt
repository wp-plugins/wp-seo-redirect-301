== Changelog ==

= 1.5 =

* Fixed redirect posts to correct urls. Fixed delete redirects which did delete but didn't refresh changes at correct time.

= 1.4 =

* Fixed some typos, whoops.

= 1.3 =

* Better description on table when you haven't yet changed your urls.

= 1.2 =

* UI to show user which old urls are pointing to the new updated urls.

= 1.1 =

* Fixed up updating children urls. So now if parent slug name changes, the child slugs are updated as well. For example, lets say you have a page called http://localhost/cars with a child page http://localhost/cars/holden, if you change the slug name to car and you navigated to http://localhost/cars it will redirect you to http://localhost/car. Similarly if you navigated to http://localhost/cars/holden it will redirect you to http://localhost/car/holden.

= 1.0 =

* Initial Checkin
